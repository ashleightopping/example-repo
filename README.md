This project is for task 1 of the Control Structures - For and While Loops lesson of the HyperionDev webdec course.

This is a simple JavaScript and HTML project for practicing number manipulation and script integration. It asks the user to enter a number of at least 3 digits, and uses a formula in Javascript to swap the first and last character of the inputted number. It then outputs the new number.

To install the project, download the files in this repository. Open task1.html in your web browser. When prompted, enter a number with at least 3 digits. Open the developer console in your browser (right-click > Inspect > Console) to see the original number you entered and the new number.
